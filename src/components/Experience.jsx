                As a Full-Stack Developer, I contributed to the team by
                designing and developing RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express,
                enabling efficient backend operations. I collaborated to
                integrate cloud storage solutions like Cloudinary and Amazon S3
                for secure, scalable media uploads with real-time processing and
                implemented real-time features such as live notifications and
                chat systems using Socket.IO. I supported the team by leveraging
                Node.js modules like http, fs, and stream to optimize
                server-side logic, data streaming, and file system operations.
                My contributions included enhancing application performance
                through clustering and asynchronous programming to handle
                high-traffic scenarios. Additionally, I worked with MongoDB for
                efficient database queries and Redis for fast data caching,
                actively participating in Agile and Scrum workflows to deliver
                scalable, high-quality applications as part of a cohesive team.{" "}
